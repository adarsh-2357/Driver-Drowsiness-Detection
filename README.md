# Driver Drowsiness Detection

## ðŸš— Project Overview

This project uses computer vision and machine learning to detect driver drowsiness in real-time using a webcam. It leverages a pre-trained deep learning model (InceptionV3) to classify whether the driver's eyes are open or closed, triggering an alarm if the eyes remain closed for a specific duration.

### ðŸ“¸ Features:
- Real-time webcam face detection
- Eye state classification (open/closed) using a deep learning model
- Alarm system that sounds when the driver is detected to be drowsy
- Automated phone call alert via Twilio API if drowsiness is detected for an extended period

## ðŸ§  Model Information

The eye detection model is based on a custom-trained neural network using the **InceptionV3** architecture, fine-tuned on the [MRL Eye Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). The model was trained using **Keras/TensorFlow** and is capable of recognizing eye states (open or closed) to monitor the driver's alertness.

Due to GitHub's file size limitations, the trained model file (`best_model.h5`) is not included in the repository.
